# tf-awx-k8s

This is an example of how to create a two node Kubernetes cluster with AWX (Ansible Web Experience).

Point the project to this playbook, create two hosts (awx-client1 = master; awx-client2 = worker) in an inventory and create a template to run.

You can also have a look at https://github.com/horni23/tf-awx to create an AWX instance with Terraform and libvirt.

More general usage for Terraform and libvirt can be found at https://github.com/horni23/tf-libvirt
